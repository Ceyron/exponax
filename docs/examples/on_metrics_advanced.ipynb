   "source": "## Consistency of the metrics computation\n\nThe discretized states in exponax $u_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times N}$ represent\ncontinuous functions sampled at an equidistant interval $\\Delta x = L/N$ where\n$L$ is the length of the domain and $N$ is the number of discretization points.\nSince we only work with **periodic boundary conditions**, we employ the\nconvention that the left point of the domain is considered a degree of freedom\nand the right point is not. Hence, $u_0$ refers to the value of the continuous\nfunction at $u(0)$ and $u_{N-1}$ refers to the value of the continuous function\nat $u(\\frac{L}{N} (N-1))$.\n\nNow assume, we wanted to compute the squared $L^2$ norm of the function $u(x)$ over the\ndomain $\\Omega = (0, L)$\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^2 \\; \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n\nA way to numerically approximate any integral with points given at equidistant\nsamples is via the trapezoidal rule. Assume we wanted to evaluate the following\nintegral\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\; \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n\nThe trapezoidal rule states that\n\n$$\nI = \\Delta x \\left( \\frac{f(0) + f(L)}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{M-1} f(i \\Delta x) \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta x = L/(M-1)$ is the distance between two consecutive points. In\ncontrast to our discretization on periodic grids, the trapezoidal rule also\naccounts for the point on the right end of the domain. However, since the right\nend of the domain must be equal to the value on the left end of the domain, we\nhave that $f(0) = f(L)$ and the trapezoidal rule simplifies to\n\n$$\nI = \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f(i \\Delta x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)\n$$\n\nOr if we had $f(x)$ discretized as $f_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where $f_h = f(i\n\\Delta x)$ with the periodic convention, we get\n\n$$\nI = \\Delta x \\sum_i f_i + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)\n$$\n\nor expressed in terms of $L$ and $N$\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{L}{N} \\sum_i f_i + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis is exactly as scaled mean\n\n$$\nI = L \\; \\text{mean}(f) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince we actually wanted to evaluate the integral over the square absolute\nfunction, we have that\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\frac{L}{N} \\sum_i |u_i|^2 + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)\n$$\n\nor again in terms of the mean\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = L \\; \\text{mean}(|u_h|^2) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)\n$$\n\nTaking the mean over the element-wise squared is nothing else than the MSE (mean\nsquared error)\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = L \\; \\text{MSE}(u_h) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence, the consistent counterpart to the squared (functional) $L^2$ norm is the\n**scaled** MSE.\n\nFor the regular $L^2$ norm, we have that\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^2 \\; \\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\n\nAs such, we get a consistent counterpart\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{L \\; \\text{MSE}(u_h) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-2}\\right)}\n$$\n\n(TODO: check this). Roughly, we can say that\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} \\approx \\sqrt{L \\; \\text{MSE}(u_h)} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nAnd we can identify the RMSE as the consistent counterpart to the $L^2$ norm.\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} \\approx \\sqrt{L} \\text{RMSE}(u_h) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is scaled by the square root of the length of the domain.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe quadratic convergence on the MSE is only valid if the function is at least\ntwice continuously differentiable. In order to be that it must be that it also\nperiodic. In such a case, the estimate (might) even converges exponentially\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule#Periodic_and_peak_functions)\nfast!\n\nAs a consequence, a bandlimited discrete function representation (might) not\nevem have a discretization error at all!\n\nOn the other hand, if the function is not periodic, the estimate likely not\nconverges quadratically. It converges linearly\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum#Left_rule) if it is continuous which\nis guaranteed by the periodicity assumption.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssuming we are on the periodic domain, we have:\n\n- A bandlimited function is exactly integrated\n- A non-bandlimited, but periodically continuous function converges\n  exponentially linear (similar to how the spectral derivative converges)\n- A discontinuous function converges linearly\n\nDue the special case how periodic grids are layed out, we will never have the\ncase of quadratic convergence."
